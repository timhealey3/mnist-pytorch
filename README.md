## MNIST

This is a simple implementation of a non-linear neural network using PyTorch to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Models

- NonLinearNN

More manual implementation of a non-linear neural network, it helps to understand the inner workings of a neural network.

- NonLinearTorch

Implementation of a non-linear neural network using PyTorch, it is a more concise implementation and perhaps more Pytorch like.

- CNN

Implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network using PyTorch. 

Results:

This test reinforces the idea that CNNs are better at classifying images than non-linear neural networks.
